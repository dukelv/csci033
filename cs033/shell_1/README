Shell_1 Readme

My program runs in a simple while loop.  Whenever the user attempts to exit, the loop simply breaks.  I implement a similar input parsing algorithm to the one provided in the handout, then perform some errorchecking, then move on to executing commands.  A fair amount of my errorchecking is handled in the execution portion using function return values and errno.  I did not write any of my own functions becuase I didn't really see any areas where they would have helped greatly (I considered using one for skipping white space -- and a few other odds and ends -- but it seemed surplus to requirement).  As far as I know there are no bugs and the shell runs fairly smoothly.  That being said, I do not have a great understanding of what the ln command does, but I think I have implemented it correctly.
